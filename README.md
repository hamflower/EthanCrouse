## Projects

### Similarity Search Tool for U.S. Census Bureau's Working Papers  
*Spring 2025*

In collaboration with two other students, we designed and implemented a custom search tool for the U.S. Census Bureau to efficiently locate relevant working papers using natural language processing.

**Overview**  
- Developed a web scraper with **Selenium** to collect working paper metadata and documents from the Census Bureau website.  
- Used **Sentence-BERT** (via the `sentence-transformers` library) to encode paper texts and user queries into vector embeddings.  
- Built a similarity search using cosine similarity to rank papers by relevance to natural language queries.  
- Created a clean, user-friendly interface.

**Key Technologies**  
- Python  
- Selenium (web scraping)  
- Sentence-BERT (semantic embeddings)  
- scikit-learn (cosine similarity)

### AES Encryption from Scratch  
*Spring 2025*

Implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Python without external libraries.  
Includes all core AES components: key expansion, SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey, supporting 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit blocks.

### Solving Feedback Control of Dynamical Systems with Reinforcement Learning  
*Spring 2025 – Research Project under Dr. Steffen Werner*

Applied reinforcement learning to compute feedback control for stabilizing unstable linear systems.  
Leveraged eigenspace reduction to isolate unstable modes, improving training efficiency.  
Trained neural network controllers on reduced models and deployed on full systems—including a 4,489-state heat flow model.

### ProseAI  
*January 2025 – Present*

An AI-powered email assistant that drafts replies to unread emails using your writing style.

**Overview**  
- Connects securely to Gmail inbox via IMAP.  
- Fetches unread emails and parses message content.  
- Uses example texts to prompt an LLM (Meta’s Llama 3B) for personalized replies.  

**Key Features**  
- Secure Gmail connection via IMAP  
- Fetch and parse unread emails  
- Generates replies from user writing examples  
- Personalized draft responses for review

### Medicaid Drug Spending Analysis  
*November 2024*

Analyzed U.S. Medicaid prescription drug data to identify spending trends across therapeutic classes and manufacturers. Built regression models and created an interactive dashboard.

**Tools:** R, ggplot2, flexdashboard, dplyr, tidyr

**Key Features**  
- Cleaned multi-year Medicaid data  
- Modeled spending with Multiple Linear Regression and Ridge Regression  
- Visualized spending patterns by drug type and manufacturer count

### Intro to Web Scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`  
*Spring 2025 – Educational Demo for Undergraduate Students*

Presented an introductory walkthrough on web scraping using Python to students at Virginia Tech. The live demo focused on extracting quotes and author names from the website [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com), covering key scraping techniques and best practices.

**Overview**  
- Demonstrated HTTP requests using the `requests` library to retrieve web page content.  
- Parsed HTML with `BeautifulSoup` to extract targeted elements like quotes and authors.  
- Showed how to iterate across multiple paginated URLs.  
- Highlighted HTML inspection for scraping logic and ethical scraping considerations.

**Key Technologies**  
- Python  
- `requests`  
- `beautifulsoup4`
